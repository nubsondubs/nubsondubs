Hello! I'm nubsondubs. Here are a few things about me:
- I love board games, but most especially Magic the Gathering. I live in a small town in a remote location, and because of the social challenges involved with this, I like to make a hobby of community building.
- I'm currently learning JavaScript! I'm especially interested in learning how to work/learn with others.
- I would like to work with anyone with similar interests as me. I'm here to meet new and interesting people, and to learn how to code in the process.
- Email me @: nubsondubs@gmail.com
